#Return the Favor

###[Return the Favor is now live!](https://returnthefavor.vet)

Return the Favor is a veteran's discount aggregator for the F.A.V.O.R. (**F**ind & **A**ssist **V**eterans **O**f **R**ecord) program in New York State. It was developed as a final project by [Albany Can Code](https://albanycancode.org) Winter 2017/2018 students.

###Features

* #####Businesses
Businesses can submit their discounts or special events to be posted (after administrator validation). RTF allows for businesses with multiple locations in the state to be consolidated into one unified listing.

* #####Veterans
Veterans can easily browse RTF for available discounts, filter by their location or desired category, or search directly for a business to see if it offers a discount. Veterans can also sign up for an email list to stay informed of discounted events and special offers.

* #####Administrators
RTF has full CRUD functionality and validation for both businesses and veterans. Data for both is stored in a MySQL database and easily exported to CSV files for external use.
